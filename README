This is distribute, a program that can be used to forward mail to mailing
lists.  So far as I know, distribute does everything correctly according to
the RFCs; should you find a problem with this, please let me know.

There's nothing special going on here, so installation should be pretty
easy.  Most places will want to use the ordinary Makefile to compile and
install this software.  If you're into the 4.3BSD-reno pmake, a pmake-style
Makefile is in Makefile.pmake.  Notice how short and simple the pmake Makefile
is... then go beat up on the vendors you deal with to get them to support
it!
