What's new in this release

o Now using mimekit (by <ysato@etl.go.jp>) to decode/encode subject before
  applying subject sustitution. To use this facility, 

	1) grab mimekit-1.8, which is in 'DeleGate' kit
	   (under directory name 'mimekit')
	   DeleGate is available at ETL server. check following web page:
		http://wall.etl.go.jp/delegate/

	2) extract DeleGate archive, go in 'mimekit' directory, then
	   run 'make.' It will crate 'libmimekit.a' and several executables.
	   Distribute only need libmimekit.a file.

	3) Install libmimekit.a to /usr/local/lib. don't forget
	   'ranlib' if necessary. You can optionally change Makefile to
	   point to DeleGate source tree.

  then, make as usual.

  next patchlevel of distribute will use 'configure', so you don't 
  need to change Makefile.

  put '-w' option turns on/off the mimekit. currently default ON, so,
  it will turn off if you give '-w.'

o -c option added. If you set this, only subscriber address in the
  recipient list can post to list.

o LOTS of bugfix in argument parsing, etc.
o some cosmetic changes.

** Makefile Change

	STRSEP_MISSING added. Please define this if your platform doesnot
	have strsep function. (available on BSDs)

	Accept addr list is now working fine. (.acc file)
	(thanks to Aplix people.) And fixed some of administrative
 	forwarding functionality.

	Now have reject list, which may contain which address should
	be rejected on submission. (.rej file) (from y-koga@ccs.mt.nec.co.jp)

	-M option behavor fix

	8th bit strip bug in euc_to_iso2022jp fixed.

	X-Reference patch (from hiro@is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp)

	Solaris patch.

	Better '-s' option hack.

	Some prototyping hack.

	Purify tested.

** Makefile Change

	CCMAIL added.  (see cc:Mail hack section for detail.)

** cc:Mail hack

	If you turn CCMAIL flag in Makefile on, special cc:Mail
	SMTPLINK hack added. Since cc:Mail SMTPLINK don't handle
	Errors-To: correctly, it may cause mailing list loop, which we
	don't want.

	Thanks to <pdp@cyber-fleet.com> for providing this hack.

** Bug Fixes

	Now correctly strip un-balanced pair of parnes in subject.
	which may cause distribute to hang.

	tmpl2pl now work fine with perl 5.

	now write INDEX file before archive run..

** Makefile Change
	Changed Makefile to set owner/group/mode. current mode using
	is 4755. Please be careful.

	DEF_DOMAINNAME added. It's compile-in default value for -h option.
	This will reduce options in command line.

	DEF_ALIAS_CHAR_OPTION added: you can specify default value for
	-B option by this.

** Reply-to Handling

	Now, -r <reply-to> option only add Reply-To header if no
	such exists.

	By -i -r <reply-to> option work same as previous version.
	(Delete Reply-To before add)

** End of header checking method changed.

	In previous versions, LCWS-char + CR Line treated as
	end of header component. In this version, such lines are ignored
	and the line only with CRLF treated as end of header.
	(per RFC822)

	Also, we do not treat FORM FEED as LCWS-char. (per RC822)

** alias brackets

	Now you can change parens to brackets or whatever you want.

	-Bp or -BP	paren		(MailingList number)	default
	-Ba or -BA	angle bracket	<MailingList number>
	-Bc or -BC	curly bracket	{MailingList number}
	-Bb or -BB	bracket		[MailingList number]

	or, you can supply by your self:

	-B+-				+MailingList number-

	But:	1. be careful about quoting
		2. you have to choose differnt character for open/close.

** default path

	If the -L/-I option's accompanied filename is not absolute path,
	compiled-in default path is attached in front of filename.
	edit Makefile for this.

** -M/-N options for easy administration

	-M/-N simplify the lines in alias file. For example, in alias file:

	>>>>
	disttest-request: shigeya
	disttest:       "|/usr/lib/distribute -M disttest"
	owner-disttest: shigeya
	<<<<

	-M is same as:
		-e -a disttest -r disttest -I disttest.seq -L disttest.rec

	-N is same as:
		-e -a disttest -I disttest.seq -L disttest.rec

	Note ".seq" and ".rec" suffixes added. 
	".seq" and ".rec" are compile time configuration option (see Makefile)


** Limit of argument passed to sendmail

	With -L option, there was limit of about 10K bytes for
	space separated recipient list. We removed this restriction,
	but you may have trouble if your OS does not support more than
	10K of argument list. (check NCARGS in sys/params.h, etc.)

	In SunOS, the max number of characters for argument list is
	1M bytes, so no problem.
