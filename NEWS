** Makefile Change
	Changed Makefile to set owner/group/mode. current mode using
	is 4755. Please be careful.

	DEF_DOMAINNAME added. It's compile-in default value for -h option.
	This will reduce options in command line.

	DEF_ALIAS_CHAR_OPTION added: you can specify default value for
	-B option by this.

** Reply-to Handling

	Now, -r <reply-to> option only add Reply-To header if no
	such exists.

	By -i -r <reply-to> option work same as previous version.
	(Delete Reply-To before add)

** End of header checking method changed.

	In previous versions, LCWS-char + CR Line treated as
	end of header component. In this version, such lines are ignored
	and the line only with CRLF treated as end of header.
	(per RFC822)

	Also, we do not treat FORM FEED as LCWS-char. (per RC822)

** alias brackets

	Now you can change parens to brackets or whatever you want.

	-Bp or -BP	paren		(MailingList number)	default
	-Ba or -BA	angle bracket	<MailingList number>
	-Bc or -BC	curly bracket	{MailingList number}
	-Bb or -BB	bracket		[MailingList number]

	or, you can supply by your self:

	-B+-				+MailingList number-

	But:	1. be careful about quoting
		2. you have to choose differnt character for open/close.

** default path

	If the -L/-I option's accompanied filename is not absolute path,
	compiled-in default path is attached in front of filename.
	edit Makefile for this.

** -M/-N options for easy administration

	-M/-N simplify the lines in alias file. For example, in alias file:

	>>>>
	disttest-request: shigeya
	disttest:       "|/usr/lib/distribute -M disttest"
	owner-disttest: shigeya
	<<<<

	-M is same as:
		-e -a disttest -r disttest -I disttest.seq -L disttest.rec

	-N is same as:
		-e -a disttest -I disttest.seq -L disttest.rec

	Note ".seq" and ".rec" suffixes added. 
	".seq" and ".rec" are compile time configuration option (see Makefile)


** Limit of argument passed to sendmail

	With -L option, there was limit of about 10K bytes for
	space separated recipient list. We removed this restriction,
	but you may have trouble if your OS does not support more than
	10K of argument list. (check NCARGS in sys/params.h, etc.)

	In SunOS, the max number of characters for argument list is
	1M bytes, so no problem.
