** default path

	If the -L/-I option's accompanied filename is not absolute path,
	compiled-in default path is attached in front of filename.
	edit Makefile for this.

** -M/-N options for easy administration

	-M/-N simplify the lines in alias file. For example, in alias file:

	>>>>
	disttest-request: shigeya
	disttest:       "|/usr/lib/distribute -M disttest"
	owner-disttest: shigeya
	<<<<

	-M is same as:
		-e -a disttest -r disttest -I disttest.seq -L disttest.rec

	-N is same as:
		-e -a disttest -I disttest.seq -L disttest.rec

	Note ".seq" and ".rec" suffixes added. 
	".seq" and ".rec" are compile time configuration option (see Makefile)


** Limit of argument passed to sendmail

	With -L option, there was limit of about 10K bytes for
	space separated recipient list. We removed this restriction,
	but you may have trouble if your OS does not support more than
	10K of argument list. (check NCARGS in sys/params.h, etc.)

	In SunOS, the max number of characters for argument list is
	1M bytes, so no problem.
